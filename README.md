  	2. Navigate to the desired directory using:
    cd
  	3. Run the following command to clone the repository:
  	git clone https://github.com/nguyenanhtu37/DriveOn_Backend.git
   
  Step 3. Run the application server
  	1. Continue by changing into the cloned project directory:
  	cd <repository_folder>
  	2. Install the required dependencies:
  	npm install or npm i
    3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables (included in source code)
  	4. Start the server using:
  	npm run dev
	After running the command, the application will be available in your browser at
	http://localhost:5000
 
  Step 4. Create a new repository on Github and deploy the application server (optional)
  To allow others to access your application without local setup, deploy it using Railway/Render. First, create a new GitHub repository and push your source code to it.
  Create a new repository on Github:
    1. Open GitHub and log in to your account.
    2. Create a new repository:
    On your GitHub homepage, click on the + sign in the top-right corner and select New repository.
    Name your repository (e.g., DriveOn_Backend)
    Add a description (optional).
    Set the repository to Public or Private (based on your preference).
    Do not initialize with a README, .gitignore, or License (since you already have these locally).
    Click Create repository.
    3. Delete the old .git folder (if any). This is necessary to remove the existing git history from the old repository:
    rm -rf .git
  	4. Initialize a new git repository: 
    git init
